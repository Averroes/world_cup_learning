world_cup_learning
==================

Just because I wanted to win a bet, some machine learning about the fifa world cup :)

Still working on it, should be ready before the 2014 cup starts playing (I will try to "predict" matches results).

And I have very little idea about football, so if you know more about the topic and have some suggestions, you are welcome to write me!
